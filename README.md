# Improve accessibility on Horiseon website

Implement the following user story:

* As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

* When I view the source code, then I find semantic HTML elements.

* When I view the structure of the HTML elements, then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

* When I view the image elements, then I find accessible alt attributes.

* When I view the heading attributes, then they fall in sequential order.

* When I view the title element, then I find a concise, descriptive title.

## Fixes made to index.html
